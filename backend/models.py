# In a simple Flask-PyMongo app, models.py might just be a conceptual representation
# as MongoDB is schemaless.
# However, you can define helper functions or classes here if needed for more complex logic.

# Example: A simple class if you were using an ORM, but for direct PyMongo, it's illustrative.
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, password_hash, xp=0, level=1):
        self.username = username
        self.password_hash = password_hash
        self.xp = xp
        self.level = level

    # You might add methods here for user-related operations,
    # but direct mongo.db.users operations are typically done in routes.
